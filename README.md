### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Wanying, and Iâ€™m a **technologist**. Iâ€™ve worn various hats in the tech world - **entrepreneur, product manager, research analyst, data analyst** -- in the past 5 years. My interest lies in technology/innovation, and I have experience in team management and product development. 

I created a start-up to improve bacterial **ear infection diagnosis** accuracy using advanced **data modeling** methods. I dived deep into the **transit dessert issue** in Georgetown and developed a suite of **data visualization** tools to enable better-informed decision-making. Iâ€™ve worked at large tech unicorns to steer their commercial platform **strategy**. I led the [Consumer Disclosure & Sustainable Supply Chains working group](https://collabathon-docs.openclimate.earth/hacks/team-contributions/consumer-disclosure-and-sustainable-supply-chains) at Yale OpenLab to address supply chain issues through the use of **blockchain**.

I have extensive experience in data analytics, market analysis, and user research. I am especially well equipped with tools like Python, SQL, Tableau, complex statistical analysis, and Human-Centered Design.

Please feel free to reach out and connect if you have great ideas to collaborate on!
